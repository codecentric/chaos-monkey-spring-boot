= Contributing to Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot
Thank you for willing to contribute! Every bit of help is highly welcome. 

This document should help you get started if you want to contribute or hack on the code.

**This is your first contribution to an open source project?** You can learn how to fork a project and how to create your first Pull Request from the excellent https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md[First Contributions] initiative.

If you are unsure where to start, please head over to our https://github.com/codecentric/chaos-monkey-spring-boot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agood-first-issue[Issue Tracker] where we have marked good beginner friendly issues. 


== Using GitHub Issues
We are using GitHub issues to track bugs, improvements and new features. If you have a general question on how to use Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot, please ask on Stack Overflow using the tag https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-boot-chaos-monkey[`#spring-boot-chaos-monkey`].


=== Reporting Bugs
Please help us to speed up problem diagnosis by providing as much information as possible. A small sample project that reproduces the error would be optimal for us. 


=== Requests for Improvements & New Features
New Pull Requests are highly welcome. However, before you provide us with a PR, please consider opening an issue using our GitHub issue tracker. This gives us the possibility to discuss the changes in details. If you're interested in an improvement or a new feature, try to provide us with your use case. 


== Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
If you found a security vulnerability please do not disclosure it publicly until we had a chance to fix it.

Please do not use our issue tracker for security vulnerabilities you found. Instead use security@codecentric.de to disclose them responsibly. You can use our public PGP (Fingerprint: https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0x8921EEE5722496E4&fingerprint=on&op=index[`0x8921EEE5722496E4`]) key to encrypt your communication if needed.

== Project Setup
Fork and clone the repository 

[NOTE]
====
To keep your fork in sync with the main project, link your `main` branch to the main repositories `main` branch. Do this by:

[source, bash]
----
git remote add upstream https://github.com/codecentric/chaos-monkey-spring-boot.git
----

To fetch upstream changes switch to your main branch with `git checkout main` and then run `git pull upstream main`.
====

Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot is a Java based https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] plugin.
On Unix based systems we recommend using https://sdkman.io/[sdkman] to manage your Java installations.
On Windows you can fallback to installing Java Development Kit 8 or higher directly.

In order to work with the code you need to use https://maven.apache.org/[Maven].
Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot uses the https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[Maven Wrapper].
To build and test the code you can run

[source, bash]
----
./mvnw clean verify
----

We are using the https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html[Google Style Guide]. The style guide
is enforced via https://github.com/diffplug/spotless[Spotless]. A check for style violations can be
run via `./mvnw spotless:check`. Use `./mvnw spotless:apply` to fix these violations.

[NOTE]
====
`./mvnw verify` also runs spotless while `./mvnw test` does not.
====

=== IntelliJ Setup
If you're using IntelliJ then we highly recommend installing the Google Style Guide file.
Download the file https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/intellij-java-google-style.xml[code style file].

[NOTE]
====
Installation of code style (download the file first):

Under `File -> Settings -> Editor -> Code Style` (Windows) or `Preferences -> Editor -> Code Style` (OSX)
press the gear button and choose `Import Scheme`. Then, select the downloaded theme file and `Apply` the style.

== Working With The Code
Considering these recommendations will help us in getting your pull request merged. 

* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (you can copy from existing files in the project).
* Document your changes. This includes in code documentation but also user documentation.
* Test your changes. Use `./mvnw verify` to run all build pipeline checks.
* It would be great to follow Chris Beam's recommendations on https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/[How to Write a Git Commit Message]. 
* Please update the https://github.com/codecentric/chaos-monkey-spring-boot/blob/main/chaos-monkey-docs/src/main/asciidoc/changes.adoc[Changes section].
* Please make sure to run the tests before you commit your changes. Using Maven you can run `./mvnw verify` which will run all tests and checks when you run the command in the root folder of the repository.
