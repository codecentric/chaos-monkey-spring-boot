== What is the goal of Chaos Monkey? ==

Inspired by http://principlesofchaos.org/[PRINCIPLES OF CHAOS ENGINEERING] and by my work in distributed system, with a focus on http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot], I wanted to test the resulting applications better and especially during operation.

After writing many unit and integration tests, a code coverage from 70% to 80%, this unpleasant feeling remains, how our baby behaves in production?

Many questions remain unanswered:

- Will our fallbacks work?
- How does the application behave with network latency?
- What if one of our services breaks down?
- Service Discovery works, but is our Client-Side-Load-Balancing also working?

As you can see, there are many more questions and open topics you have to deal with.

That was my start to take a deep dive into Chaos Engineering and I started this little project to share my thoughts and experience.

A detailed explanation of when and why you should use the Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot https://codecentric.github.io/chaos-monkey-spring-boot/[can be found here].
